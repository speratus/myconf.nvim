# Myconf

This repository is intended to host my personal Neovim configurtaion.

While you are welcome to clone it yourself, be warned that I have no intention of providing
any level of support beyond that which satisfies my own needs. To that end, expect these
configurations to change without any notice and in ways that might cause your preferred
configurations to break.
